# Google Fiber Customer Satisfaction Project

## Project Overview
[Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/) is a broadband internet company that provides fiber optic internet to both residential and commercial customers. The customer service team would like to use business intelligence tools to monitor and improve customer satisfaction. Leadership would like to better understand the circumstances in which customers contact customer service more than once for the same inquiry, how often, and why. Google Fiber requested a dashboard tool to explore the trends in repeat calls. This will help leadership develop a customer support strategy that fully addresses inquiries in the first call.

The objectives of the planning stage are to review the meeting notes to identify the relevant stakeholders and to organize tasks into milestones. The following documents were prepared to document the stakeholder requirements, project requirements, and project strategy.
