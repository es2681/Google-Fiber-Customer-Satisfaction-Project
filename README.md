# Google Fiber Customer Satisfaction Project

## Project Overview
[Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/) is a broadband internet company that provides fiber optic internet to both residential and commercial customers. The customer service team would like to use business intelligence tools to monitor and improve customer satisfaction. Leadership would like to better understand the circumstances in which customers contact customer service more than once for the same inquiry, how often, and why. Google Fiber requested a dashboard tool to explore the trends in repeat calls. This will help leadership develop a customer support strategy that fully addresses inquiries in the first call.

## Stage I - Planning
Detailed notes were collected during a project meeting. The objectives of the planning stage are to review the meeting notes to identify the relevant stakeholders and to organize tasks into milestones. The following documents were prepared to document the stakeholder requirements, project requirements, and project strategy.
[Stakeholder Requirements Document] encapsulates stakeholder needs and requests to better understand the project scope prior to planning teh project details and strategy.
[Project Requirements] Document establishes the information needed to achieve the stakeholder requests.
[Strategy Document] outlines the plan to meet the project goals and flesh out deliverables.

- Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year

#### Data
To anonymize and fictionalize the data, the datasets the columns market_1, market_2, and market_3 to indicate three different city service areas the data represents. 

The data also lists five problem types:
- Type_1 is account management

- Type_3 is scheduling
- Type_4 is construction
- Type_5 is internet and Wi-Fi

Additionally, the dataset also records repeat calls over seven-day periods. The initial contact date is listed as contacts_n. The other call columns are then contacts_n_number of days since first call. For example, contacts_n_6 indicates six days since first contact.
